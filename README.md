# Minesweeeper
This code represents a digital reenactment of a World War I minesweeping mission, adapted for the web in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this mission, the player must navigate through a grid-like battlefield, identifying and marking hidden mines while avoiding detonating them. The game emulates three levels of difficulty to replicate the varying intensity of wartime minesweeping: Easy, Hard, and Nuts.

### Quote from actual player:
> "Navigating through the treacherous waters, marking the lurking dangers, and ensuring the safety of our fellow soldiers was a test of our wit, courage, and determination. This digital battlefield brings back the intensity and camaraderie we experienced during those long, perilous days on the front lines."

## The structure of the code is as follows:
1. **HTML**: The HTML code establishes the foundation of the minesweeping mission, including the mission title, strategic toolbar, battlefield grid, and status updates in the footer.
2. **CSS**: The CSS code outlines the visual presentation of various components, such as the battlefield grid, individual sectors, command buttons, and textual elements. It also sets the default sector dimensions, color schemes, and typographical elements for the mission.
3. **JavaScript**: The JavaScript code embodies the intelligence and mechanics of the minesweeping mission. It manages user interactions, such as selecting sectors, flagging potential mines, unveiling neighboring sectors, and keeping track of the mission timer. The code includes functions for generating the battlefield, configuring the mission based on the chosen difficulty, restarting the mission, disclosing mines and intelligence, and determining victory or defeat.

In essence, this code offers a complete digital rendition of minesweeper, enabling users to experience the thrill and challenge of minesweeping through their web browser.
